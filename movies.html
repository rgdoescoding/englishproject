        In finding Nemo, Marlin thinks of Nemo and Nemo thinks of Marlin. They both still feel and think of each other but they are in different parts of the world. Relating back to our school year, the separation that exist doesnt stop us students from continuing to work with each other.

      <p class="ferdinand-desc">
        In Ferdinand, Ferdinand is separated from his master, Nina, when his former captors try to reclaim him. He is forced to a bullfighting ring and is about to kill the person he is fighting but steps on a flower which reminds him of Nina and decides not to kill. Although he and Nina are apart, he still thinks of her and her ideals. They are apart but their minds are similar and together.

        In five feet apart both characters are in a relationship but have to stay five feet apart from each other. They are quite literally apart but together. It relates to our school year because people in DVA and in person have to work with each other despite being separate.
