      <p class="show-desc">
        In the show your lie in april, the main character, Kousei, is often separated from the person who helps him play piano. By the end of the show, he feels her presence with him even though they are not physically together. It relates to the school year because although people were separated by in person and DVA, we were all in the same classroom similar to how kousei is not with his friend physically but still feels her presence.

      <p class="show-desc">
        In the witcher, the entire show is based on the premise that the characters Geralt and Ciri are trying to find each other. By the end of the show Ciri states that People linked by destiny will always find each other, meaning that even if they are not together physically, people will always be with each other. It relates to the theme of apart but together because people will always be with each other even if not physically.
